    {
      "question": "What is data binding?",
      "answer": "Data binding synchronizes data between the component and the template using interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is two-way data binding?",
      "answer": "Two-way data binding keeps the view and model in sync using [(ngModel)]."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are directives?",
      "answer": "Directives add behavior to DOM elements. Types include structural (*ngIf, *ngFor) and attribute (ngClass, ngStyle)."

      "question": "What is JIT compilation?",
      "answer": "Just-in-Time compilation compiles the application in the browser at runtime."
    },
